## z_sendmany

**z_sendmany "fromaddress" [ { "address": ..., "amount": ... }, ... ] ( minconf ) ( fee )**

The `z_sendmany` method sends one or more transactions at once, and allows for sending transactions of types `t --> t`, `t --> z`, `z --> z`, `z --> t`. It is the principle method for dealing with shielded `z` transactions in the Komodo ecosystem.

The `amount` values are double-precision floating point numbers. Change from a t address flows to a new t address address, while change from z address returns to itself. When sending coinbase utxos to a z address, change is not allowed. The entire value of the utxo(s) must be consumed. Currently, the maximum number of z address outputs is 54 due to transaction-size limits.
