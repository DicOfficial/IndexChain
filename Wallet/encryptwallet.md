## encryptwallet

**encryptwallet "passphrase"**

Using the `encryptwallet` method will shutdown the Indexchain daemon (`indexchain`).

This feature is available only on chains where `-ac_public` is enabled. Chains that feature private transactions cannot use this feature.

The `encryptwallet` method encrypts the wallet with the indicated `passphrase`.

This method is for first-time encryption only. After the first encryption, any calls that interact with private keys will require the passphrase via walletpassphrase prior to calling the corresponding method. This includes methods that create a transaction, dump a private key for an address, sign a transaction, etc.
