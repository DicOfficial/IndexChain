## getbalance64

**getbalance64**

This method is part of the new **ac_staked** functionality.

The `getbalance64` method is used only on asset chains that are utilizing the `ac_staked`functionality. On KMD-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) asset chains, all staked coins are placed into one of 64 segments (`segid`'s'). The `getbalance64` method returns the balance of coins in each `segid`.
