## z_gettotalbalance

**z_gettotalbalance ( minconf includeWatchonly )**

The `z_gettotalbalance` method returns the total value of funds, including both transparent and private, stored in the nodeâ€™s wallet.

CAUTION: If the wallet contains watch-only z addresses the returned private balance may be larger than the actual balance, as spends cannot be detected with incoming viewing keys.

While the **interest** property is returned for all KMD-based coin daemons, only the main KMD chain utilizes the interest feature. KMD-based asset chains will always return a **0.00** interest value.
