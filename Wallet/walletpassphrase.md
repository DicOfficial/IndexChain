## walletpassphrase

**walletpassphrase "passphrase" (timeout)**

The `walletpassphrase` method is neither active nor visible in the `help` method until the [encryptwallet](https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/komodo-api/wallet.html#encryptwallet) passphrase is set.

This feature is available only on chains where `-ac_public` is enabled. Chains that feature private transactions cannot use this feature.

The `walletpassphrase` method unlocks the wallet using the passphrase that was set by the [encryptwallet](https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/komodo-api/wallet.html#encryptwallet) method.

The `timeout` argument can be included to limit the length of time (in seconds) the wallet will remain unlocked.
