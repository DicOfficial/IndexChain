## z_mergetoaddress

**z_mergetoaddress [ "fromaddress", ... ] "toaddress" ( fee ) ( transparent_limit ) ( shielded_limit ) ( memo )**

CAUTION: **z_mergetoaddress** is DISABLED but can be enabled as an experimental feature.

The `z_mergetoaddress` method merges multiple utxos and notes into a single utxo or note. The method works for both t addresses and z addresses, both separately and in combination. Coinbase utxos are ignored; use `z_shieldcoinbase` to combine those into a single note.

This is an asynchronous operation, and utxos selected for merging will be locked. If there is an error, they are unlocked. The RPC call `listlockunspent` can be used to return a list of locked utxos.

The number of utxos and notes selected for merging can be limited by the caller. If the transparent limit parameter is set to `0`, the `mempooltxinputlimit` option will determine the number of utxos. Any limit is constrained by the consensus rule defining a maximum transaction size of 100000 bytes.

### The fromaddresses array

The following special strings are accepted inside the `fromaddresses` array:

- `"*"`: Merge both utxos and notes from all addresses belonging to the wallet
- `"ANY_TADDR"`: Merge utxos from all t addresses belonging to the wallet
- `"ANY_ZADDR"`: Merge notes from all z addresses belonging to the wallet

If a special string is given, any given addresses of that type will be ignored

### Arguments

| Name              | Type                                | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| fromaddresses     | (string, required)                  |                                                              |
| "address"         | (string)                            | can be a t address or a z address                            |
| "toaddress"       | (string, required)                  | the t address or z address to receive the combined utxo      |
| fee               | (numeric, optional, default=0.0001) | the fee amount to attach to this transaction                 |
| transparent_limit | (numeric, optional, default=50)     | limit on the maximum number of transparent utxos to merge; you may set this value to 0 to use the node option [mempooltxinputlimit](https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/installations/common-runtime-parameters.html#mempooltxinputlimit) |
| shielded_limit    | (numeric, optional, default=10)     | limit on the maximum number of hidden notes to merge; you may set this value to 0 to merge as many as will fit in the transaction |
| "memo"            | (string, optional)                  | encoded as hex; when `toaddress` is a z address, this value will be stored in the memo field of the new note |
